# gotest

A Go tool that runs `go test` recursively in the current directory and all subdirectories containing Go files, generates a coverage HTML report, and opens it in your default browser.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/hjia/gotest@latest
```

Or build locally:

```bash
go build -o gotest .
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run tests in all Go packages with default settings
gotest

# Pass any go test flags
gotest -v
gotest -v -race
gotest -run TestSpecific
gotest -timeout 30s -v

# All standard go test arguments are supported
gotest -count=1 -parallel=4
```

## What it does

1. **Finds all Go packages** - Scans the current directory and subdirectories for any `*.go` files
2. **Runs `go test`** - Executes tests with coverage profiling on all discovered packages
3. **Generates coverage report** - Creates `/tmp/cover.html` with detailed coverage visualization
4. **Opens in browser** - Automatically opens the coverage report in your default browser

## Coverage Output

- Coverage profile: `/tmp/cover.out`
- HTML report: `/tmp/cover.html`

## Skipped Directories

The following directories are automatically skipped:
- Hidden directories (starting with `.`)
- `vendor/`
- `testdata/`

## Platform Support

- macOS (uses `open`)
- Linux (uses `xdg-open`)
- Windows (uses `start`)
